# Capabilities Directory

This directory is the actual registry content: one file tree per published capability version.

## Layout

```text
capabilities/<namespace>/<id>/<version>/contract.json
```

- `<namespace>` — reserved for future third-party publishers; defaults to `core` for everything published by the Traverse team today (see `specs/001-registry-foundation/spec.md`, FR-008).
- `<id>` — the capability identity within its namespace.
- `<version>` — an exact semver version. Each version is its own immutable directory — never edit an existing version's `contract.json` after merge. To fix a bad publish, see the deprecation/yank process in `specs/001-registry-foundation/spec.md` (User Story 4).

Artifact binaries (WASM, etc.) are **not** committed here — they're referenced by digest + GitHub Release URL from within `contract.json` (see `specs/001-registry-foundation/spec.md`, FR-007).

This directory is currently empty — no capabilities have been published yet.
