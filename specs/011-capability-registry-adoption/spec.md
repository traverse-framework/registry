# Feature Specification: Capability Registry (Adopted from traverse#005)

**Feature Branch**: `011-capability-registry-adoption`
**Created**: 2026-07-18
**Status**: Approved
**Input**: Re-adoption of `traverse-framework/traverse`'s `005-capability-registry` (approved there 2026-03-27), as part of the `traverse-registry` crate extraction (`traverse` spec `051-registry-extraction`, `traverse#627`, this repo's #9). Decided via `/brainstorm` with the repo owner, 2026-07-18. Full reasoning: `docs/decision-log.md` entry 29.

**Enforcement note**: `crates/traverse-registry/` now physically exists in this repo (the `010-crate-publish-pipeline` scaffold, #52), so this spec registers directly in `specs/governance/approved-specs.json` rather than waiting -- the concern in decision log entry 26(f) was specifically about declaring governance over a path that doesn't exist yet; that no longer applies. The placeholder crate does not yet implement this spec's functional requirements -- registering the spec ahead of the implementation catching up is the normal spec-driven order (precedent: decision log entry 22, spec 007 implemented while still Draft), not a claim that the FRs are already satisfied.

## Why This Is a Re-Adoption, Not a Fresh Spec

Unlike most of the specs that touched `crates/traverse-registry/` in `traverse`, `005-capability-registry` was already registry-exclusive there in every meaningful sense: its only other listed governed path (`crates/cogolo-registry/`) refers to a pre-rename crate that no longer exists on disk. Its full content -- registry storage/indexing, public/private overlay precedence, semver-aware publication and immutability, composability metadata, composed-capability representation -- is entirely about registry behavior, none of it about `traverse-runtime`, `traverse-cli`, or any crate staying in `traverse`. It is copied here verbatim (see decision log entry 29's hybrid-coverage decision) rather than referenced-and-inherited the way the other 19 specs are (`013-inherited-registry-governance`), because copying it costs nothing extra and preserves full FR-level traceability inside this repo.

`traverse`'s own copy of `005-capability-registry` has its `governs` trimmed to remove `crates/traverse-registry/` once `traverse#627` lands (that repo's own spec no longer governs any path that exists there) -- the two copies diverge from this point forward as independently-governed documents, consistent with how `051-registry-extraction` itself was already a new spec formalizing a move rather than an edit of what it superseded.

## Purpose

This specification defines the capability registry slice for `traverse-registry`: making governed capabilities discoverable, versioned, composable, and stable without weakening the contract as the source of truth.

This spec defines:

- registry storage and indexing behavior for capability contracts
- public registry plus private overlay behavior
- artifact reference handling for source and WASM binary metadata
- semver-aware publication and immutability rules
- explicit composability metadata indexing
- composed capability representation

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Register and Discover a Capability Version (Priority: P1)

As a platform developer, I want to register a capability contract and discover it later by identity, version, and metadata so that Traverse can treat capabilities as stable governed building blocks instead of ad hoc files.

**Why this priority**: Registry discovery is the operational bridge between contract authoring and runtime execution.

**Independent Test**: A valid capability contract and artifact manifest can be registered into the registry, indexed, and later discovered by exact identity/version and by metadata queries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid approved capability contract and matching artifact metadata, **When** registration succeeds, **Then** the registry stores the contract, derived index entry, artifact reference entry, and discoverability metadata.
2. **Given** a registered capability identity with multiple versions, **When** a lookup requests an exact version, **Then** the registry returns the matching immutable record.
3. **Given** a metadata query such as owner, tags, composition role, or lifecycle, **When** registry discovery runs, **Then** the registry returns deterministic results ordered predictably.

### User Story 2 - Preserve Stability Through Semver and Immutability (Priority: P1)

As a capability consumer, I want the registry to preserve semver stability and reject unsafe republishing so that my application or workflow can depend on capability versions with confidence.

**Why this priority**: The registry is where Traverse must do better than the weak honor-system parts of package ecosystems.

**Independent Test**: Registering the same capability version with different governed content fails, while valid forward versions are checked against prior versions and accepted only when semver rules are satisfied.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a published capability identity and version, **When** a different governed contract digest is registered under the same identity and version, **Then** registration fails.
2. **Given** a prior published capability version and a new candidate version, **When** semver compatibility validation runs against the contract diff, **Then** registration fails if the declared bump is too small for the detected change class.
3. **Given** a consumer requesting a compatible version range later, **When** the registry resolves versions, **Then** the registry can distinguish exact, compatible, and breaking versions from contract-governed metadata.

---

### User Story 3 - Support Public Ecosystem and Private App Overlays (Priority: P2)

As an application builder, I want to use both shared public capabilities and app-specific private capabilities so that my system can compose common building blocks without giving up private business logic.

**Why this priority**: Traverse must support both an ecosystem model and app-local capability sets.

**Independent Test**: A lookup across a configured public registry and local private overlay resolves deterministic results with private overlay precedence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a capability registered in the public registry and a capability with the same identity in the private overlay, **When** lookup runs in the local application context, **Then** the private overlay entry takes precedence.
2. **Given** a capability that exists only in the public registry, **When** the private overlay has no matching record, **Then** discovery falls back to the public registry.
3. **Given** a private overlay registration, **When** the capability is queried later, **Then** the registry exposes the scope as private/local rather than public.

---

### User Story 4 - Discover Safe Composition Paths (Priority: P2)

As a developer or agent, I want the registry to expose composability metadata and composed capabilities clearly so that I can build reusable workflows and higher-level capabilities without guessing how capabilities fit together.

**Why this priority**: Traverse's value depends on safe, inspectable composition, not just storage of isolated contracts.

**Independent Test**: The registry can answer queries about atomic versus composed capabilities, composition roles, and downstream/upstream composition metadata deterministically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an atomic capability contract, **When** it is registered, **Then** the registry indexes its explicit composability metadata.
2. **Given** a composed capability contract backed by a workflow definition, **When** it is registered, **Then** the registry records it as a first-class capability with a workflow-backed implementation reference.
3. **Given** a discovery query for capabilities that can participate in enrichment, validation, or event-driven composition, **When** the registry evaluates indexed metadata, **Then** it returns matching capabilities predictably.

## Scope

In scope:

- capability contract storage and indexing
- artifact metadata records for source references and WASM binaries
- public registry plus private overlay model
- deterministic lookup and precedence rules
- contract immutability rules
- semver compatibility enforcement hooks based on contract diffs
- composability metadata indexing
- composed capability representation

Out of scope:

- event registry behavior (see `012-event-registry-adoption`)
- workflow registry behavior beyond composed capability references
- runtime execution
- remote artifact store implementation beyond the abstraction and metadata model

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The capability registry MUST treat the capability contract artifact as the governing source of truth for capability identity, boundary, lifecycle, and semver.
- **FR-002**: The registry MUST store the original capability contract artifact and MUST NOT replace it with a derived record as the authoritative source.
- **FR-003**: The registry MUST maintain a generated index optimized for discovery and lookup.
- **FR-004**: The registry MUST maintain artifact metadata records separate from the contract artifact.
- **FR-005**: Artifact metadata MUST support source references, WASM binary references, content digests, and provenance metadata.
- **FR-006**: The registry MUST support a public registry scope and a private/local overlay scope using the same contract model.
- **FR-007**: Lookup MUST prefer the private/local overlay over the public registry when both contain matching identities in the same lookup context.
- **FR-008**: Published capability identity plus version pairs MUST be immutable.
- **FR-009**: Registration MUST fail when the same published identity and version are reused with different governed contract content.
- **FR-010**: Registration MUST validate declared semver progression against the previous published version using contract-diff compatibility rules.
- **FR-011**: The registry MUST support exact version lookup and metadata discovery.
- **FR-012**: The registry MUST persist enough metadata to support future compatible-version resolution without redesigning the registry model.
- **FR-013**: The registry MUST index explicit composability metadata from the capability contract.
- **FR-014**: The registry MUST distinguish atomic capabilities from composed capabilities.
- **FR-015**: A composed capability MUST be represented as a first-class capability contract whose implementation reference points to a deterministic workflow definition rather than a direct executable artifact.
- **FR-016**: The registry MUST store enough implementation metadata to distinguish executable-artifact-backed capabilities from workflow-backed capabilities.
- **FR-017**: Registration MUST preserve lifecycle, owner, scope, provenance, and evidence metadata for each published capability version.
- **FR-018**: The registry MUST produce deterministic results for the same stored records and query inputs.
- **FR-019**: Registration and lookup failures MUST produce stable machine-readable error records with error code, path or target, and explanation.
- **FR-020**: Successful registration MUST produce machine-readable registration evidence linked to the capability identity, version, governing spec, and artifact digests.
- **FR-021**: The registry MUST be designed around an artifact storage abstraction, even when only a local adapter is implemented.
- **FR-022**: Approved implementation under this spec MUST be validated against this governing spec before merge.

### Key Entities

- **Capability Registry Record**: The stored representation of a versioned capability contract plus governed metadata needed for discovery.
- **Capability Registry Index Entry**: The derived lookup-friendly metadata representation built from a capability contract and related artifact records.
- **Capability Artifact Record**: Metadata describing source references, WASM binaries, digests, provenance, and implementation backing.
- **Capability Scope**: The visibility context for a capability version, initially `public` or `private`.
- **Composition Metadata**: Machine-readable metadata describing how a capability can participate in safe composition.
- **Implementation Kind**: The implementation backing classification for a capability, initially `executable` or `workflow`.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001 Determinism**: Registration and lookup results MUST be deterministic for the same input records.
- **NFR-002 Stability**: The registry model MUST preserve immutable publication semantics and predictable semver governance.
- **NFR-003 Discoverability**: Indexed metadata MUST support human and agent discovery without requiring raw contract inspection for common queries.
- **NFR-004 Maintainability**: The registry MUST clearly separate contract storage, artifact metadata, and derived indexing concerns.
- **NFR-005 Portability**: Artifact metadata and implementation records MUST not assume a single hosting backend or transport mechanism.
- **NFR-006 Testability**: Core registration, immutability, precedence, and lookup logic MUST be structured for full automated coverage.

## Non-Negotiable Quality Gates

- **QG-001**: No registry implementation may merge unless it preserves contract primacy and immutable publication semantics.
- **QG-002**: Public/private overlay precedence MUST be explicit and tested.
- **QG-003**: Semver validation based on contract diffs MUST be part of registry publication behavior, not a manual-only process.
- **QG-004**: Composed capabilities MUST remain first-class discoverable capabilities and MUST NOT be hidden as undocumented workflow-only artifacts.

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: A capability can be registered once and discovered later by exact identity and version.
- **SC-002**: Republishing the same version with different governed content is rejected deterministically.
- **SC-003**: The registry can distinguish public and private capability records with deterministic lookup precedence.
- **SC-004**: Atomic and composed capabilities are both discoverable as first-class capabilities.
- **SC-005**: Registry implementation can be protected by the same spec-alignment and coverage discipline as this repo's other governed content.

## Governing Relationship

This specification is adopted from, and supersedes for this repo's purposes, `traverse-framework/traverse`'s `005-capability-registry`.

This specification governs `crates/traverse-registry/` in this repo.
